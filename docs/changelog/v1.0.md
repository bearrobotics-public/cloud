### Release: Bear Cloud API v1.0
### Minimum Robot Software Versions
1. Servi: 24.04.1
2. Carti: 24.03.1

### Key Features 
#### Mission Type Messages
Introduces mission types as first-class message types to create and send missions. This provides a clear distinction between mission types compatible with different robot families.
Example: TraverseMission is only applicable to Carti robots.

#### Unified Map Data Retrieval
Consolidates map-related data access into a single endpoint to retrieve relevant map annotation dats, simplifying automated navigation and mission commands.

#### Multi-Robot Subscription Support
Enables selection of multiple robots via RobotSelector in subscription endpoints, allowing monitoring of all robots in a location with a single API call per endpoint.

#### Improved Error Handling
Enhances error messaging and diagnostics for better overall API usability.

### New API Customers
Please contact your Account Manager to discuss API use cases and request API keys.

### Impact on Beta Customers
Bear Cloud API v1.0 is not backward compatible with Beta v0.1. Current Beta users must download and compile the new v1.0 Protobuf library. Refer to the functional comparison table below and follow the Upgrade Guide. Contact Customer Support or your Account Manager if additional help is needed.

#### How to Upgrade
1. Review the v1.0 [API endpoint specification](../v1.0/resources/Mission.md).
2. Upgrade robot software to the compatible versions listed above.
3. Download and compile the new v1.0 Protobuf library. See our Programming Guide and examples for relevant endpoints.
4 . Test your integration against the new version.

!!! Note
    Our robot software supports backward compatibility, allowing switching between v0 and v1 for a stable migration.



#### API Functionality Comparison: Beta v0.1 vs. Prod v1.0
| v0.1 Beta                     | [v1.0 Prod](../v1.0/resources/Mission.md)         | Whatâ€™s Changed                                                                                  |

| CreateMission                | CreateMission                                    | Mission behavior now indicated by message type, <br /> e.g. `TraverseMission`and `BussingMission`     |
| UpdateMission                | UpdateMission                                    | Same as above, follows the mission type model                                                   |
| SubscribeMissionStatus       | SubscribeMissionStatus                           | v0.1 supports only one `robot_id`; v1.0 supports `RobotSelector` for multi-robot monitoring     |
| GetCurrentMapContent <br /> GetMap <br />  GetMapAnnotation <br />  GetMapData         | GetCurrentMap | v0.1 requires chaining multiple endpoints; <br /> v1.0 consolidates into a single call              |
| SubscribeTrayStatuses        | SubscribeTrayStatuses                            | v0.1 lacks tray names; <br /> v1.0 returns map keyed by tray name, supports `RobotSelector`           |
| SubscribeRobotPose           | SubscribeRobotPose                               | v0.1 supports single-robot pose tracking; v1.0 supports multi-robot with `RobotSelector`        |

These are streaming endpoints that provide real-time updates on robot health, including battery levels, charging state, and connectivity.

## SubscribeBatteryStatus
A [server side streaming RPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#server-streaming-rpc) endpoint to get battery state updates for the robot. Upon subscription, the latest battery state is sent immediately. Updates are streamed whenever the state changes.

### Request
##### selector `RobotSelector` `required`
`RobotSelector` is used to select specific robots. <br/>
 It supports selection by a list of robot IDs **OR** all robots at a given location.

| Field | Message Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
|`robot_ids`| `RobotIDs`| Selects robots by their specific IDs. <br/> Example: `["pennybot-123abc", "pennybot-abc123"]` |
|`location_id`|`string` |  Selects all robots at the specified location. |

### Response

##### metadata `EventMetadata`

| Field | Message Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | [Timestamp](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/src/google/protobuf/timestamp.proto) | The time when the event was recorded. |
| `sequence_number` | int64 | An incremental sequence number generated by the robot.<br />The sequence number should never be negative and can be reset to 0.<br />i.e. sequence is valid if it is larger than the previous number or 0. |

##### robot_id `string`
The robotID the message is associated with.

##### BatteryState
Represents the state of the robot's battery system.

| Field | Message Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|

| STATE_DISCHARGING          | 2      | Robot is not connected to a charger and is consuming battery power.         |
| STATE_FULL           | 3      | Battery is fully charged while connected to a charger; <br />no additional energy is being stored.                    |

##### ChargeMethod `enum`
| Name                   | Number | Description                                      |
|------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| CHARGE_METHOD_UNKNOWN          | 0      | Default value. It means the `charge_method` field is not returned. |
| CHARGE_METHOD_NONE          | 1      | No charging method is currently active or applicable. |
| CHARGE_METHOD_WIRED          | 2      | Charging via a wired connection.     |
| CHARGE_METHOD_CONTACT           | 3      | Charging via contact-based interface (e.g., docking station).|

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | Attempting to request status for `RobotIDs`  or a `location_id` you don't own. <br /> Tip: check the spelling of the `RobotIDs` or `location_id`.|

Provides controls and subscriptions related to a robot’s position within its environment, including localization and pose tracking.

-----------
## LocalizeRobot 
Localizes the robot to a known pose or destination. <br />

If the request is accepted, subscribe to [**SubscribeLocalizationStatus**](#subscribelocalizationstatus) 
to track localization progress. <br />

### Request
##### robot_id `string` `required`
The ID of the robot that the localization command is sent to.

##### goal `Goal` `required`
[Goal](../../concepts/mission.md#goals) represents a target destination or pose for the robot to localize to.

| Field  | Message Type | Description |
|------------|-------------| ---|
|[destination_id](../../v1.0/resources/LocationsAndMaps.md) | `string` | Unique identifier for the destination.|
|[Pose](../../concepts/localization.md)| [`Pose`](../../v1.0/resources/Localization.md#pose) |`x_meters` *float* X-coordinate in meters within the map. <br/> `x_meters` *float* Y-coordinate in meters within the map. <br/> `heading_radians` *float* The heading of the robot in radians. Ranges from -π to π, where 0.0 points along the positive x-axis.|

##### JSON Request Example
=== "JSON"
    ```js
      {
        "robotId": "pennybot-123123",

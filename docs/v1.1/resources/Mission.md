[Missions](../../concepts/mission.md#missions) are atomic units of behavior that define a robot's high-level actions.
This API enables users to control robot behaviorâ€”from simple navigation
tasks to complex, conditional workflows.

    ```

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|`FAILED_PRECONDITION`   |  The robot is already executing another mission. This command is valid if current mission is in [terminal state](#state-enum). </br> e.g., Cancelled, Succeeded, Failed |
|`INVALID_ARGUMENT`    |   The client supplied a request with invalid format. This covers sending empty requests, invalid goals, goals that do not match mission type, and other format errors. Client should update their usage to have correctly formatted requests with valid goals for the missions as defined in documentation. |
|`INTERNAL`    |   The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry creating the mission.
|`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`    |  The request was sent internally, but timed out waiting for confirmation response of request being accepted. Client should retry creating the mission. |

-----------
## AppendMission 
Appends a mission to the end of the [mission queue](../../concepts/mission.md#mission-queue). <br/>
Use this when a mission is currently running; otherwise, prefer [CreateMission](#createmission). <br/>

### JSON Request / Response Example
!!! note ""
    AppendMission request and response message types are the same as [CreateMission](#createmission).  
    See [CreateMission JSON Examples](#json-request-example).

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|`FAILED_PRECONDITION`   |  There is no mission in the mission queue. Client should first create the initial mission, and only use Append for queuing additional missions. |
|`INVALID_ARGUMENT`    |   The client supplied a request with invalid format. This covers sending empty requests, invalid goals, goals that do not match mission type, and other format errors. Client should update their usage to have correctly formatted requests with valid goals for the missions as defined in documentation. |
|`INTERNAL`    |   The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry appending the mission. |
|`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`    |  The request was sent internally, but timed out waiting for confirmation response of request being accepted. Client should retry appending the mission. |

-----------

`ChargeRobot` is a special type of mission. Use this command to instruct the robot to begin charging, regardless of its current battery level. <br />

This command is only supported on robots equipped with a contact-based charging dock. Robots without a compatible dock will return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error. <br />

You can use [`SubscribeBatteryStatus`](RobotStatus.md#subscribebatterystatus) to monitor the charging process. 

### Request

##### robot_id `string` `required`

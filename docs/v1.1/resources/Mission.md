[Missions](../../concepts/mission.md#missions) are atomic units of behavior that define a robot's high-level actions.
This API enables users to control robot behaviorâ€”from simple navigation
tasks to complex, conditional workflows.

------------
## CreateMission 
Send a robot on a mission of specified type. 
<br/>

### Request

##### robot_id `string` `required`
The ID of the robot that will receive this command.


##### mission `Mission` `required`
Universal wrapper for mission types. Only one [mission type](../../concepts/mission.md#mission-types) may be set at a time.

| Field (*oneof*) | Message Type | Description |
|------------|-------------| ---|
|`base_mission`   |[`BaseMission`](#base_mission-basemission)	| Base missions are specific to the Base units. |
|`servi_mission`	|[`servi.Mission`](Servi.md#servi_mission-servimission) | Servi missions are specific to the Servi robot family. <br /> Refer to [Servi](Servi.md) for how to create and send a servi mission. |
|`carti_mission`	|[`carti.Mission`](Carti.md#carti_mission-cartimission)	| Carti missions are specific to the Carti robot family.<br /> Refer to [Carti](Carti.md) for how to create and send a carti mission. |

#### `BaseMission`
Use the `base_mission` field to send a mission to a Base unit. Current API version supports 2 types of base missions.

| Field (*oneof*) | Message Type | Description |
|------------|-------------| ---|
|`navigate_mission`   |[`NavigateMission`](#navigate_mission-navigatemission)	| Create a base mission of type `Navigate`. |
|`navigate_auto_mission`	|[`NavigateAutoMission`](#navigate_auto_mission-navigateautomission)| Create a base mission of type `NavigateAuto`. |

#### `NavigateMission`
A mission consisting of a single, explicitly defined goal.

| Field  | Message Type | Description |
|------------|-------------| ---|
|`goal`   |[`Goal`](../LocalizationAndNavigation/#goal-goal-required)<br>`required`	| The target destination for the mission. |


#### `NavigateAutoMission`
A mission that automatically selects the **first unoccupied and unclaimed goal** from the provided list, preferring goals with lower index values.

For example, when sending a robot to one of several possible goals `[T1, T2, T3]`, it will first check if `T1` is unoccupied and unclaimed, then `T2`, and finally `T3`. If all goals are occupied (other robot is already present) or claimed (other robot is already en route to the destination), the mission will fail.

| Field  | Message Type | Description |
|------------|-------------| ---|
|`goals`   |*repeated* [`Goal`](../LocalizationAndNavigation/#goal-goal-required)<br>`required`	| The **list** of target destinations for the mission. |

        }
      }
    ```

### Response

##### **mission_id** `string`
The ID of the mission created. 

##### JSON Response Example
=== "JSON"
    ```js
      {
        "missionId": "cbd47ab1-df21-479e-9f72-677b81ab55b0"
      }
    ```

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|`FAILED_PRECONDITION`   |  The robot is already executing another mission. `CreateMission` is only valid if there is no running mission on the target robot, with its state in one of the [terminal states](#state-enum), i.e., Cancelled, Succeeded, Failed, Default |
|`INVALID_ARGUMENT`    |   The client supplied a request with invalid format. This covers sending empty requests, invalid goals, goals that do not match mission type, and other format errors. Client should update their usage to have correctly formatted requests with valid goals for the missions as defined in documentation. |
|`INTERNAL`    |   The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry creating the mission.
|`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`    |  The request was sent internally, but timed out waiting for confirmation response of request being accepted. Client should retry creating the mission. |

-----------
## AppendMission 
Appends a mission to the end of the [mission queue](../../concepts/mission.md#mission-queue).
Use this when a mission is currently running; otherwise, prefer [CreateMission](#createmission). 
Missions are executed in the order they are appended.

### Request / Response
!!! note 
    AppendMission request and response message types are the same as [CreateMission](#createmission). See [CreateMission JSON Examples](#json-request-example).

### Errors
| ErrorCode  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|`FAILED_PRECONDITION`   |  There is no mission in the mission queue. Client should first create the initial mission, and only use Append for queuing additional missions. |
|`INVALID_ARGUMENT`    |   The client supplied a request with invalid format. This covers sending empty requests, invalid goals, goals that do not match mission type, and other format errors. Client should update their usage to have correctly formatted requests with valid goals for the missions as defined in documentation. |
|`INTERNAL`    |   The request failed to execute due to internal error in mission system. Client should retry appending the mission. |
|`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`    |  The request was sent internally, but timed out waiting for confirmation response of request being accepted. Client should retry appending the mission. |

-----------
## UpdateMission 
Issues a command to control or update the current mission (e.g., pause, cancel).

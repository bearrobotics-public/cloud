This is critical for operation, as the robot needs to have an accurate understanding of its place in the environment in order to navigate reliably. Once localized, our robots are able to keep themselves localized as they move through an environment, using sensor data to compare what it sees to what is on its map. This means it only needs to figure out where it is once, and can stay localized from there. A robot may become delocalized, meaning it has lost track of where it is in the map. This can happen for various reasons, such as:</p> <ol> <li>It cannot find walls or landmarks from its map in the sensor data</li> <li>Often because walls are obscured by lots of new obstacles</li> <li>It encounters an area that looks very similar to many other locations in the    map</li> <li>For example, a long featureless hallway looks the same to the sensors from       many different places</li> <li>It faces significant slippage of the wheels</li> <li>This is more rare as we have compensation for wheel slip, but if       significant enough, it can confuse the robot</li> </ol> <p>In the event of delocalizing, the user will need to trigger localization again to tell the robot where it is, before having it navigate again.</p> <p>Some clear definitions for localization terminology are as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Localized</li> <li>Robot knows where it is in the environment</li> <li>Localizing</li> <li>Robot is currently running a process to figure out where it is</li> <li>Currently our API does this with a hint about its position, given by the       user</li> <li>Eventually this hint will not be required, and robot can do the initial       localization on its own</li> <li>Delocalized</li> <li>Robot has lost track of where it is in the environment</li> <li>Likely this means it cannot navigate anymore</li> <li>In this event, the user will need to localize the robot again to tell the       robot its current location</li> <li>Pose</li> <li>The x-y coordinate on the robot\u2019s map</li> <li>This is used frequently to say either where the robot is, or for telling       the robot where it is on the map</li> </ol> <p>We supply a mechanism for triggering a robot localization.

As mentioned, missions can have very little complexity or a lot depending on how much logic the user wants the robot to execute. This allows developers to choose whether they want to delegate the workflow of the robot to a more complex mission, or manage more of the logic in their app and use smaller missions with less logic. Bear provides several pre-defined mission types, available through the API. These range from some simple mission types shared across all robot families, to some more complex missions exposed only to their respective robot family.</p> <p>For example, a user wanting a Servi-family robot to complete a restaurant delivery workflow could make use of a DeliveryMission. This has logic to take several goals (positions in the map), navigate to each one, and wait for food to be removed before moving onto the next goal. It also includes things like prompting the customer to remove food, and other quality-of-life behaviors for the restaurant delivery use-case. This is useful for things like touchscreen control apps, allowing your application to send simple mission requests to accomplish a restaurant workflow, without much logic in the application itself.</p> <p>Alternatively, you may want more control over the robot\u2019s behavior, and want to trigger things through your own app instead. Using a simpler mission like NavigateMission (which just navigates to a single goals before finishing), you can tell the robot to just move to a goal, and have your app decide when to send the next navigation to a goal. This is useful for when you have a fleet manager dispatching robots, and need full control of the exact actions and timings for the robots.</p> <p>The types of missions available are filtered per-robot-family, meaning that each family has a select set of missions the user can send it.

This ensures clients can have stable feedback despite many different mission types being available to send to the robot.</p> <p>Missions will populate information in the feedback as they are available. For example, given the following definition for Servi robot-family feedback:</p> <pre><code>// Servi Robot-Family Feedback\nmessage Feedback {\n  enum Status {\n    STATUS_UNKNOWN = 0;\n    STATUS_NAVIGATING = 1;\n    STATUS_ARRIVED = 2;\n    STATUS_DOCKING = 3;\n    STATUS_UNDOCKING = 4;\n  }\n  Status status = 1;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This covers all potential states our missions can report to the client. However, not all missions are guaranteed to utilize all of these states. A NavigateMission may not have <code>STATUS_ARRIVED</code>, as it only contains <code>STATUS_NAVIGATE</code> before the mission ends.</p> <p>With this in mind, clients should build their applications to handle cases where states may show up in different orders, and all states may not even show up. Clients should not build applications that depend heavily on the ordering that each of these states arrive at, as different missions may have different behaviors in different orders. Building an application that relies on this means the mission cannot change without potentially breaking the client app.</p> <p>A better way is to build your app such that it has handling for every possible state for Servi Feedback. That way no matter what mission you send, and what order the states appear, your app can properly adapt. A good example of this is building a touchscreen application to show mission feedback. If the touchscreen app has a dedicated page for each state, it can simply show the correct screen corresponding to a given status reported by the mission. If the Docking status never shows up, the screen simply does not display. This is resilient to changes in mission behavior as the application does not care what order or which statuses within the feedback show up.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"concepts/status/","title":"Status","text":"<p>Status is defined as current realtime state of a set of values.
